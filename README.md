Hi there! My name is [Lorenzo Sisti](https://sites.google.com/view/lorenzosisti) and I'm a Biochemistry student at Sapienza University of Rome. Iâ€™m trained as a computational and structural biologist - although my academic background has a strong biomedical and microbiological focus - and my research interests focus on Biochemistry, Biophysics and Bioinformatics.
