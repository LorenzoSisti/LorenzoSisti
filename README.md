Hi there! My name is [Lorenzo Sisti](https://sites.google.com/view/lorenzosisti) and I'm a Biochemistry student at Sapienza University of Rome. I‚Äôm trained as a computational and structural biologist - although my academic background has a strong biomedical and biomolecular focus. My main research interests lie at the intersection of Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Bioinformatics, with a particular focus on:

- Proteins and antibodies structure, folding and interactions.
- Computational modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins.

After a B.Sc. wet-lab thesis internship in [Francesca Cutruzzol√†'s group](https://sites.google.com/uniroma1.it/francescacutruzzola-eng/home), where I explored the interactions between metabolic enzymes of the folate cycle and nucleic acids, I joined [Jan Dohn√°lek's Laboratory of Structure and Function of Biomolecules](https://www.ibt.cas.cz/en/research-laboratories/laboratory-of-structure-and-function-of-biomolecules/) for an internship in crystallography and structural biology. I then transitioned to dry-lab for my M.Sc. thesis in Computational Biophysics at the [IIT's Center for Life Nano- & Neuro-Science](https://www.iit.it/it/clns-sapienza). In parallel, I collaborated with the [Structural Bioinformatics Group at Sapienza University of Rome](https://schubert.bio.uniroma1.it/index.html) on molecular dynamics simulations of the DOPA decarboxylase enzyme. Since february 2025, I collaborate with the haematology department of Tor Vergata Hospital as data manager.
